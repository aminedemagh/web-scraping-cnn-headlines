### Description
This project is a command-line application that extracts news headline's data of [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/) and puts it in an excel file (.xlsx file). The data includes the title, link, date, and the article's text of the headlines. 

This app uses [Selenium webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/). It is a tool that takes control of a web browser (Firefox for this project) to access websites programmatically.
