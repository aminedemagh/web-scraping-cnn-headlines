### Date created
This project was created on 2020-12-25.

### Description
This project is a command-line application that extracts news headline's data of [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/) and puts it in an excel file (.xlsx file). The data includes the title, link, date, and the article's text of the headlines. 

This app uses [Selenium webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/). It is a tool that takes control of a web browser (Firefox for this project) to access websites programmatically. 

### Files used
- `cnn_scrapper.py` : the file that contains the code for extracting the data.
- `geckodriver.exe` : the driver that Selenium needs to take control of Firefox. You can dowload it from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). 

Note that you also need to update [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) to the latest version.
